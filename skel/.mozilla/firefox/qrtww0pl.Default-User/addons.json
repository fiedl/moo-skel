Using interactive visualizations, Lightbeam shows you the relationships between these third parties and the sites you visit.","fullDescription":"About this Add-on\nUsing interactive visualizations, Lightbeam enables you to see the first and third party sites you interact with on the Web. As you browse, Lightbeam reveals the full depth of the Web today, including parts that are not transparent to the average user. Using three distinct interactive graphic representations — Graph, Clock and List — Lightbeam enables you to examine individual third parties over time and space, identify where they connect to your online activity and provides ways for you to engage with this unique view of the Web.\n\nHow Lightbeam Works\nWhen you activate Lightbeam and visit a website, sometimes called the first party, the add-on creates a real time visualization of all the third parties that are active on that page. The default visualization is called the Graph view. As you then browse to a second site, the add-on highlights the third parties that are also active there and shows which third parties have seen you at both sites. The visualization grows with every site you visit and every request made from your browser. In addition to the Graph view, you can also see your data in a Clock view to examine connections over a 24-hour period or in a List view to drill down into individual sites.\n\nHow You Can Use Lightbeam to Help Us Illuminate the Inner Workings of the Web\nAs a part of Lightbeam, we're creating a big-picture view of how tracking works on the Internet, and how third-party sites are connected to multiple other sites. You may contribute your data to our crowdsourced directory by simply turning on the share switch within the add-on. To disable crowdsourcing, you can turn it off at any time. You can view your local data stored within Lightbeam at any time, or save your data by clicking the \"Save\" button under the data section on the left side of the add-on.\n\nHow is my information stored?\nAs a default, all info generated and used for Lightbeam’s visualizations and features are only stored locally on your computer. You can save a copy of your connection history at any time, which is also where you can see the specific data collected by the add-on. You may also reset Lightbeam to erase your locally stored connection history, disable it to stop data collection or uninstall it to instantly remove all locally stored data related to Lightbeam. Additional information related to Lightbeam’s file format is available here\n\nThe origins of Lightbeam\nLightbeam began in July 2011 as Collusion, a personal project by Mozilla software developer Atul Varma. Inspired by the book The Filter Bubble, Atul created an experimental add-on to visualize browsing behavior and data collection on the Web.\n\nIn February 2012, Gary Kovacs, Mozilla CEO at the time, introduced the Collusion add-on in a TED talk (now one of the most watched TED talks) about exposing online tracking.\n\nIn September 2012, Mozilla joined forces with students at Emily Carr University of Art + Design to develop and implement visualizations for the add-on. With the support of the Ford Foundation and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC), Collusion has been re-imagined as Lightbeam and was launched in the fall of 2013.\n\nTo read more about the collaboration, please visit http://www.simcentre.ca\n\nFeedback\nYour input is valuable to us, so don’t forget to rate, review or give us feedback after using Lightbeam.

Additional web-specific features, such as our ‘Hint’ mode, command interface, and key bindings to automatically follow back and forward links, make it easy to navigate without touching the mouse and give Pentadactyl a habit forming nature of its own.\n\nPentadactyl is a fork of the Vimperator project by most of its primary developers. Major differences include a 7-fold startup speed improvement and other speed improvements elsewhere, the command-line is hidden by default, better private mode and :sanitize support, better forward and reverse incremental find support, and the ability to separate multiple Ex commands with a |. For a more complete list, see the release announcement.\n\nMajor features include:\n\n    Vim-like keybindings (h, j, gg, ZZ, <C-f>, etc.)\n    Ex commands for nearly all functionality (:quit, :open

The toolbar button will change color depending on the strength of encryption from red (weak) to green (strong). The drop down window shows a detailed summary of the SSL connection.","fullDescription":"Please update to the latest version of Firefox to take advantage of the latest SSL ciphers. Then make sure you have the latest version of the Calomel add on. We are only supporting the latest version of our add on on the latest version of Firefox.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nUPDATE 3: Firefox 27 added two 128 bit Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) ciphers. Only GCM enabled sites are able to get a 100% score and the green icon. Please upgrade to FF27!\n\nUPDATE 2: Firefox 25 now allows the add on to query the full cipher suite. We have added the ability to grade the connection on each part of the cipher including key exchange, signature, bulk cipher and message authentication code. We also check and grade the cipher if it supports Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS). \"Calomel SSL Validation\" version 0.64 for Firefox 25 and above is now available.\n\nUPDATE 1: With Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) in the news we have posted to the Mozilla developer lists asking for the ability to collect the full cipher name from Firefox. Until we can get more information from the browser we can not add additional functionality the the addon. https://forums.mozilla.org/addons/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=14680\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe \"Calomel SSL Validation\" add-on grades the SSL cipher strength of the current connection. Access to a detailed summery of the SSL negotiation is supplied by a toolbar button you can now place on any toolbar. The button also will change color depending on the grade from red (low score), to orange, to yellow, to blue and finally to green (high score). Standard HTTP unencrypted connections will turn the URL bar icon gray.\n\nThis add-on was designed to more easily show the true security state of the connection so everyone can learn more about ciphers and encryption using SSL. Firefox currently shows a green URL tag for an extended validation (EV) or a blue URL tag for a domain validation (DV) certificate and a lock icon if the connection is SSL encrypted. We did not think this was enough information to decide if the connection to the site was truly secure. This is why the \"Calomel SSL Validation\" add-on was developed. We score the connection on the following items: if the certificate was valid, if the fully qualified host name is equal to the common name the certificate was registered for and the strength of the cipher and cipher key length.\n\nIn the \"Preferences\" section you can find many options we find extremely useful like:\n\n::- Use of only the strongest 256 bit ciphers in high security mode in addition to disabling the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP). There is also a toggle under the \"Tools\" menu to turn the FIPS-140 high strength ciphers on or off instantly.\n\n::- The \"optimization\" tab to enable settings similar to those found in FasterFox, but unlike that add-on we only enable safe, Mozilla acceptable configurations. This tab provides speed optimizations we found to increase the \"quickness\" of the browser while using less CPU time and bandwidth.\n\n::- In the Privacy tab you can choose to hide titles and icons in each of the tabs similar to the add on \"Page Title Eraser\". This option might be used to stop people looking over your shoulder to see what sites you have open.\n\n::- Finally, there is a tab to disable annoyances like blinking text and gif animations commonly seen in ads.\n\nAll of these options are disabled by default when you install the add-on. We do not believe it is ethical to change a user's built-in settings automatically. Take a look at our help page and decide for yourself what you would like to use. The help page should be shown in an additional tab after the add-on is installed.\n\nA detailed and comprehensive explanation of the options and scoring can be found on our help page at the \"Website\" link above.\n\nPrivacy and security are very important to us. This add-on does NOT contact any external sources about browsing habits or SSL statistics. All information is retrieved from Firefox itself and kept internal to only your user. The add on does NOT store any personal or metadata information other then your preferences (as about:config values) to protect your privacy.\n\nSecurely,\nCalomel @ https://calomel.org","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/132/132504.png?src=api&modified=1396025642","width":"525","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/132/132504.png?src=api&modified=1396025642","thumbnailWidth":"150","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"calomel.org supporting Perfect Forward Secrecy and a strong secure connection."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/132/132506.png?src=api&modified=1396025642","width":"527","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/132/132506.png?src=api&modified=1396025642","thumbnailWidth":"150","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"google with a very strong connection including PFS and ECDSA signed certificate."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/132/132508.png?src=api&modified=1396025642","width":"525","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/132/132508.png?src=api&modified=1396025642","thumbnailWidth":"150","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"cia.gov with a weak security profile without Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/132/132510.png?src=api&modified=1396025642","width":"638","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/132/132510.png?src=api&modified=1396025642","thumbnailWidth":"182","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"paypal with a very weak \"encrypted\" connection. sites handling currency should know better."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/132/132512.png?src=api&modified=1396025642","width":"507","height":"507","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/132/132512.png?src=api&modified=1396025642","thumbnailWidth":"150","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"NSA main site; an example site with no encryption at all."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/132/132514.png?src=api&modified=1396025642","width":"462","height":"465","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/132/132514.png?src=api&modified=1396025642","thumbnailWidth":"149","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"the add-on \"security\" tab from the options window."}],"averageRating":4,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/calomel-ssl-validation/?src=api","homepageURL":"https://calomel.org/firefox_ssl_validation.html","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/257802/calomel_ssl_validation-0.72-fx.xpi?src=api","size":195819,"developerComments":"INSTALLATION NOTES: After the initial install, the Calomel toolbar button will be placed to the left of the URL location bar.

These color edits can be permanently saved and be im-/exported for sharing.\n\nWhy?\n• Perhaps you want to get an impression of how your own site looks like in different colors.\n• .. or the color set of a specific site/page causes headaches. Why not change it?\n• .. or you simply like to experiment.\n\nHow?\nStart up this add-on when you like to change the colors of a site. Then press the button [Go!] and change the colors for Foreground (Text) and Background with some dials.\n\n'Under the hood' this Add-On does (apparently) more: It overrides the CSS of a site and uses a number of \"tricks\" to be as complete as possible. Also image processing and re-encoding is done to change the color of (background-)images.\n\nLimitations:\n• On complex sites with many background images this add-on might need much memory while editing.\n• Contents which use plugins like Flash or PDF files can not be changed.\n• Whether color edits on one web page apply to the whole site or not, depends on the sites CSS structure. But multiple edits can be applied to different pages/folders of the site.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/47/47510.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","width":"700","height":"520","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/47/47510.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"148","caption":"Examples of colour changes done with this add-on.
