Improve the privacy of your browsing by not letting other sites know your browsing habits. Secure yourself from Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and other attacks.","fullDescription":"RequestPolicy's new version is under development as RequestPolicy Continued. Ultimately, I'd like RequestPolicy Continued to replace RequestPolicy.\n\nRequestPolicy development has been slow because I am working on ServerPilot, a cPanel alternative for DigitalOcean servers. Thankfully, some great community members are taking over development of RequestPolicy.\n\n----\n\nRequestPolicy is an extension that improves the privacy and security of your browsing by giving you control over when cross-site requests are allowed by webpages you visit.\n\nCross-site requests are requests that your browser is told to make by a website you are visiting to a completely different website. Though usually legitimate requests, they often result in advertising companies and other websites knowing your browsing habits, including specific pages you view throughout the day. Among the attacks that cross-site requests are used in, they are particularly dangerous with Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks where your browser is told to make a request to another website and that other website thinks you (the person) meant to make the request.\n\nWith RequestPolicy, the default for any cross-site request is to deny it. Users are notified when requests on the current page have been blocked (the status bar flag icon at the bottom right of your browser turns red). Clicking on this status bar flag icon gives you a menu where you can view and modify which requests are blocked and allowed. You can whitelist requests you approve of by origin site, destination site, or specific origin-to-destination.\n\nMore information on the privacy reasons for using RequestPolicy is available at:\nhttps://www.requestpolicy.com/privacy\n\nMore information on the security reasons for using RequestPolicy is available at:\nhttps://www.requestpolicy.com/security\n\nRequestPolicy is not a replacement for NoScript! Each focuses on different, important issues. For the best security, we recommend using both RequestPolicy and NoScript. More information on the difference between the two is available here:\nhttps://www.requestpolicy.com/faq#faq-noscript\n\n*********************************************************************************\nNOTE: As with any extension that blocks content, some websites will not work properly until you have allowed the required content. If a website you visit isn't working, you can use the RequestPolicy menu to allow the cross-site requests the website needs. After a short while of using RequestPolicy, you will have whitelisted all of the required cross-site requests for sites you frequently visit and you will use the RequestPolicy menu much less.\n*********************************************************************************","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/27/27523.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","width":"343","height":"251","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/27/27523.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"146","caption":"You can see which requests have been allowed and chose to revoke permissions that you granted earlier."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/27/27522.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","width":"700","height":"208","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/27/27522.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"59","caption":"You can allow requests from a specific origin site to a specific destination site.

Largely inspired by the Vim text editor, the appearance and finger feel of Pentadactyl should be familiar to Vim users. Additional web-specific features, such as our ‘Hint’ mode, command interface, and key bindings to automatically follow back and forward links, make it easy to navigate without touching the mouse and give Pentadactyl a habit forming nature of its own.\n\nPentadactyl is a fork of the Vimperator project by most of its primary developers. Major differences include a 7-fold startup speed improvement and other speed improvements elsewhere, the command-line is hidden by default, better private mode and :sanitize support, better forward and reverse incremental find support, and the ability to separate multiple Ex commands with a |. For a more complete list, see the release announcement.\n\nMajor features include:\n\n    Vim-like keybindings (h, j, gg, ZZ, <C-f>, etc.)\n    Ex commands for nearly all functionality (:quit, :open www.foo.com, …)\n    Powerful tab completion for all commands and options, including,\n        ‘Auto-completion’ shows you available results as you type\n        Configurable URL and search keyword completion, including ‘awesome bar’ results\n        Context-sensitive, programmable JavaScript completion with paren matching and syntax error highlighting\n        Descriptions of commands and options, along with informational and error messages\n    Powerful privacy features, including\n        Private mode (‘porn mode’) support, where no data is written to disk and all new private information is wiped on exit\n        Fine grained sanitizer to clear data like command-line history, cookies, and page history\n        Ability to sanitize specific hosts and for specific time periods (i.e., clear all references to google.com for the past 5 minutes)\n    Page search with many fixes for long-standing Firefox annoyances, including,\n        Starts at the cursor position in the currently selected frame, unlike Firefox, which always starts at the beginning of the first frame for documents with more than one frame.\n        Returns the cursor and viewport to their original position on cancel.\n        Backtracks to the first successful match after pressing backspace, unlike Firefox, which will always continue from the last match.\n        Supports reverse incremental search.\n    Keyboard macros, along with custom key mappings and commands\n    Plugins and color schemes\n    Quick and powerful keyboard navigation for links, input fields, etc.\n    Vim-like status line with a Wget-like progress bar\n    Minimal GUI, along with commands to hide and toggle toolbars and menus\n    Ability to :source JavaScript, CSS, and Pentadactyl command files.\n    Visual bell for errors ('visualbell')\n    Ability to mark the current page position and return to it\n    QuickMarks for the sites you visit most\n    Editing of text fields with an external editor\n
