Used to clean up cookies from certain sites or clean up all cookies except from certain sites. This can be done both on demand by a simple click or automatically.","fullDescription":"Update: Firefox 4 : This addon can be used in Firefox4 from the \"Addon Bar\" - To make add on bar visible in the bottom: Rightclick on any part of the top bar, select \"Addon bar\" and you can see the icon of this application at the bottom right. I will find some other way to make this easy without the addon bar.\n\nThis addon helps you remove cookies from certain hosts based on pre-selected preference. User has the option to either set preference to 1) remove all cookies except cookies from certain hosts 2) remove cookies only from certain specified hosts 3) remove all cookies. Once the preferences are set, user can apply this preference by normal left click on the cookie icon, added to the status bar. User's selected preference is kept so that user has does not need to type in list of host names again and again. When you use firefox standard option to remove all cookies, you loose useful cookies that store your preferences and logged in sessions. With this addon you are in control of what you can delete or keep with one simple click. This is useful to periodically remove cookies from sites that put restriction based on information kept in cookies.\nUser can also select option to automatically remove the cookies as per rule whenever firefox is closed.\n\n\nIcon is automatically added to the status bar at bottom right of the firefox window. Right click on the icon opens the preferences page, as shown in the screen shot attached. User has three option to chose from in this preferences window\n\n1. Remove only cookies from specified hosts\nWith this option selected, user can enter comma(,) seperated list of hostnames in the text box.\nWith this preferences, cookies from the specified hosts are removed, keeping others intact\nYou can use this option to specifically delete cookies from specific sites, without removing all cookies.\nUse button provided to select the hosts or type in the host name\n\n2. Remove all except cookies from specified hosts\nWith this option selected, user can enter comma(,) seperated list of host names.\nWith this preference, the add on removes cookies from every host, except cookies from the specified hosts\nYou can use this option to keep list of hosts from which you do not want to delete cookie. For example, google, yahoo.co.uk, times.com,etc.\nUse button provided to select the hosts or type in the host name\n\n3. Remove all cookies\nUser can select this option to remove all cookies\n\n\"Edit Hosts\" button allows the user to see the selected hosts and also add more hosts without having to type in name of hosts.\n\nPlease remember you do not need to use \"Edit Hosts\" button if you want to keep very small number of hosts. You can always type it in, for example \"google, yahoo, mozilla\", instead of full host name.\n\nIn addition to this \"Show all cookies\" button shows your all cookies that are already present in machine and allows you to remove specific cookies.\n\nDo mail me if you have issues or for suggesting features. If you like the addon, please give your review. Please do send in translations of the labels/text shown in the addon in your language, I will be happy to add it.

Protects against trackers and zombie-cookies. Trustworthy services can be whitelisted.","fullDescription":"Self-Destructing Cookies is not just a cookie manager, it's a new cookie policy. Do you think that cookies should need a reason to persist in your cookie jar, i.e. you currently interacting with the site that set them? Would you prefer your cookie jar to be empty in its steady state, except for a few sites that you care about? Are you worried about unconventional tracking methods? Then give this add-on a try.\n\nSelf-Destructing Cookies automatically removes cookies when they are no longer used by open browser tabs. With the cookies, lingering sessions, as well as information used to spy on you, will be expunged. Websites will only be permitted to identify you while you actually use them and can not stalk you across the entire web. This is the closest you will get to cookieless browsing without breaking every second site or tedious micromanaging.\n\nTracking cookies will be detected and removed immediately. They are identified purely by their behaviour - no need for a blacklist that needs to be kept up to-date. Self-Destructing Cookies also has LocalStorage support and will treat it just like your cookie jar. Defend yourself against ETag tracking and other cache-based black-hat techniques by configuring Self-Destructing Cookies to automatically clean your cache every time you are not actively using the browser. For the first time ever, this provides a realistic chance of beating zombie-/evercookies without sacrificing usability. See the zombie-cookie FAQ entry for details. Self-Destructing Cookies can also help protect against CSRF attacks by ending your sessions as soon as possible.\n\nThis add-on complements blacklist-based solutions such as Adblock and Ghostery very well. You can whitelist sites whose cookies and LocalStorage you would like to keep without an active tab in the Firefox cookie exception list, which can also be conveniently accessed from the add-on's preferences, or an icon in the Add-on Bar.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions and Common Problems\n\nQ: What about Zombie-/Evercookies?\nA: SDC gives you a fighting chance against such black-hat techniques. To beat the Evercookie, enable automatic cache cleaning in SDC's preferences. If you are on a decent, unmetered connection, there is no harm in setting the idle timeout to a low value, such as 3 minutes. You should also set all of your plugins to click-to-play, install BetterPrivacy and configure it to automatically clean unused LSOs. Please note that SDC will not clean LocalStorage scopes of sites served via HTTPS if you are running a Firefox version prior to 23. This is due to a limitation in Firefox's DOM storage API in those versions.\n\nQ: Can I disable the notification pop-ups?\nA: Yes. Open the add-on manager. You can reach it via Firefox's menu, or by just entering \"about:addons\" without the quotes in your location bar. Locate Self-Destructing Cookies in your list of extensions, click the Preferences button and remove the checkmark next to \"Notifications\".\n\nQ: Since I installed the add-on, the removal notifications just won't stop. I'm not even using the browser at the moment.\nA: You are probably using another add-on that re-adds certain cookies when they are removed, e.g. Beef Taco or TrackerBlock which both try to persist opt-out cookies. SDC and the other add-on are having an infinite debate about whether to keep those cookies. Choose a side and disable the other one.\n\nQ: The entire whitelist is empty each time I restart Firefox.\nA: You probably have Firefox's privacy preferences set to \"Clear History when Firefox closes\" and included \"Site Preferences\" in the corresponding menu. SDC's whitelist is stored as site preferences.\n\nQ: A specific site forgets my login, even though it is on my whitelist.\nIf you added the entries manually, make sure you whitelisted the base domains of your sites (e.g. \"example.com\", not \"www.example.com\"). That's where cookies are generally stored.\nIf you added it via the icon, the login might depend on external domains. Keep an eye on the removal notifications the next time you log *in* there. The domains that appear in the following seconds are probably the ones you want on your whitelist as well.\n\nQ: The add-on does not work in private browsing mode.\nA: Some parts of Firefox are off-limits for add-ons while you are in private browsing mode. This includes the cookie jar for example. There's nothing I can do about this, sorry.\n\nQ: I have configured Firefox to block all cookies by default. Can I still use SDC?\nA: There is an unsupported hidden setting that changes the behaviour of the \"yellow\" whitelist level from allow-for-session to allow-while-open. To enable it, create a boolean key in your about:config named \"extensions.jid0-9XfBwUWnvPx4wWsfBWMCm4Jj69E@jetpack.defaultBlock\" (without the quotes), set it to true and restart your browser. You can now use the \"yellow\" setting for sites whose cookies you would like to accept, but still have them self-destruct. I provide this on a \"should work\" basis, meaning that I depend on bug reports from you and don't do in-depth testing of this mode myself.\n\nIf you need support or would like to report a bug, I encourage you to use the Support E-Mail link near the top-right of this page.

Using interactive visualizations, Lightbeam shows you the relationships between these third parties and the sites you visit.","fullDescription":"About this Add-on\nUsing interactive visualizations, Lightbeam enables you to see the first and third party sites you interact with on the Web. As you browse, Lightbeam reveals the full depth of the Web today, including parts that are not transparent to the average user. Using three distinct interactive graphic representations — Graph, Clock and List — Lightbeam enables you to examine individual third parties over time and space, identify where they connect to your online activity and provides ways for you to engage with this unique view of the Web.\n\nHow Lightbeam Works\nWhen you activate Lightbeam and visit a website, sometimes called the first party, the add-on creates a real time visualization of all the third parties that are active on that page. The default visualization is called the Graph view. As you then browse to a second site, the add-on highlights the third parties that are also active there and shows which third parties have seen you at both sites. The visualization grows with every site you visit and every request made from your browser. In addition to the Graph view, you can also see your data in a Clock view to examine connections over a 24-hour period or in a List view to drill down into individual sites.\n\nHow You Can Use Lightbeam to Help Us Illuminate the Inner Workings of the Web\nAs a part of Lightbeam, we're creating a big-picture view of how tracking works on the Internet, and how third-party sites are connected to multiple other sites. You may contribute your data to our crowdsourced directory by simply turning on the share switch within the add-on. To disable crowdsourcing, you can turn it off at any time. You can view your local data stored within Lightbeam at any time, or save your data by clicking the \"Save\" button under the data section on the left side of the add-on.\n\nHow is my information stored?\nAs a default, all info generated and used for Lightbeam’s visualizations and features are only stored locally on your computer. You can save a copy of your connection history at any time, which is also where you can see the specific data collected by the add-on. You may also reset Lightbeam to erase your locally stored connection history, disable it to stop data collection or uninstall it to instantly remove all locally stored data related to Lightbeam. Additional information related to Lightbeam’s file format is available here\n\nThe origins of Lightbeam\nLightbeam began in July 2011 as Collusion, a personal project by Mozilla software developer Atul Varma. Inspired by the book The Filter Bubble, Atul created an experimental add-on to visualize browsing behavior and data collection on the Web.\n\nIn February 2012, Gary Kovacs, Mozilla CEO at the time, introduced the Collusion add-on in a TED talk (now one of the most watched TED talks) about exposing online tracking.\n\nIn September 2012, Mozilla joined forces with students at Emily Carr University of Art + Design to develop and implement visualizations for the add-on. With the support of the Ford Foundation and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC), Collusion has been re-imagined as Lightbeam and was launched in the fall of 2013.\n\nTo read more about the collaboration, please visit http://www.simcentre.ca\n\nFeedback\nYour input is valuable to us, so don’t forget to rate, review or give us feedback after using Lightbeam.

Largely inspired by the Vim text editor, the appearance and finger feel of Pentadactyl should be familiar to Vim users. Additional web-specific features, such as our ‘Hint’ mode, command interface, and key bindings to automatically follow back and forward links, make it easy to navigate without touching the mouse and give Pentadactyl a habit forming nature of its own.\n\nPentadactyl is a fork of the Vimperator project by most of its primary developers. Major differences include a 7-fold startup speed improvement and other speed improvements elsewhere, the command-line is hidden by default, better private mode and :sanitize support, better forward and reverse incremental find support, and the ability to separate multiple Ex commands with a |. For a more complete list, see the release announcement.\n\nMajor features include:\n\n    Vim-like keybindings (h, j, gg, ZZ, <C-f>, etc.)\n    Ex commands for nearly all functionality (:quit, :open

The toolbar button will change color depending on the strength of encryption from red (weak) to green (strong). The drop down window shows a detailed summary of the SSL connection.","fullDescription":"Please update to the latest version of Firefox to take advantage of the latest SSL ciphers. Then make sure you have the latest version of the Calomel add on. We are only supporting the latest version of our add on on the latest version of Firefox.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nUPDATE 3: Firefox 27 added two 128 bit Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) ciphers. Only GCM enabled sites are able to get a 100% score and the green icon. Please upgrade to FF27!\n\nUPDATE 2: Firefox 25 now allows the add on to query the full cipher suite. We have added the ability to grade the connection on each part of the cipher including key exchange, signature, bulk cipher and message authentication code. We also check and grade the cipher if it supports Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS). \"Calomel SSL Validation\" version 0.64 for Firefox 25 and above is now available.\n\nUPDATE 1: With Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) in the news we have posted to the Mozilla developer lists asking for the ability to collect the full cipher name from Firefox. Until we can get more information from the browser we can not add additional functionality the the addon. https://forums.mozilla.org/addons/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=14680\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe \"Calomel SSL Validation\" add-on grades the SSL cipher strength of the current connection. Access to a detailed summery of the SSL negotiation is supplied by a toolbar button you can now place on any toolbar. The button also will change color depending on the grade from red (low score), to orange, to yellow, to blue and finally to green (high score). Standard HTTP unencrypted connections will turn the URL bar icon gray.\n\nThis add-on was designed to more easily show the true security state of the connection so everyone can learn more about ciphers and encryption using SSL. Firefox currently shows a green URL tag for an extended validation (EV) or a blue URL tag for a domain validation (DV) certificate and a lock icon if the connection is SSL encrypted. We did not think this was enough information to decide if the connection to the site was truly secure. This is why the \"Calomel SSL Validation\" add-on was developed. We score the connection on the following items: if the certificate was valid, if the fully qualified host name is equal to the common name the certificate was registered for and the strength of the cipher and cipher key length.\n\nIn the \"Preferences\" section you can find many options we find extremely useful like:\n\n::- Use of only the strongest 256 bit ciphers in high security mode in addition to disabling the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP). There is also a toggle under the \"Tools\" menu to turn the FIPS-140 high strength ciphers on or off instantly.\n\n::- The \"optimization\" tab to enable settings similar to those found in FasterFox, but unlike that add-on we only enable safe, Mozilla acceptable configurations. This tab provides speed optimizations we found to increase the \"quickness\" of the browser while using less CPU time and bandwidth.\n\n::- In the Privacy tab you can choose to hide titles and icons in each of the tabs similar to the add on \"Page Title Eraser\". This option might be used to stop people looking over your shoulder to see what sites you have open.\n\n::- Finally, there is a tab to disable annoyances like blinking text and gif animations commonly seen in ads.\n\nAll of these options are disabled by default when you install the add-on. We do not believe it is ethical to change a user's built-in settings automatically. Take a look at our help page and decide for yourself what you would like to use. The help page should be shown in an additional tab after the add-on is installed.\n\nA detailed and comprehensive explanation of the options and scoring can be found on our help page at the \"Website\" link above.\n\nPrivacy and security are very important to us. This add-on does NOT contact any external sources about browsing habits or SSL statistics. All information is retrieved from Firefox itself and kept internal to only your user. The add on does NOT store any personal or metadata information other then your preferences (as about:config values) to protect your privacy.\n\nSecurely,\nCalomel @ https://calomel.org","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/132/132504.png?src=api&modified=1396025642","width":"525","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/132/132504.png?src=api&modified=1396025642","thumbnailWidth":"150","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"calomel.org supporting Perfect Forward Secrecy and a strong secure connection."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/132/132506.png?src=api&modified=1396025642","width":"527","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/132/132506.png?src=api&modified=1396025642","thumbnailWidth":"150","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"google with a very strong connection including PFS and ECDSA signed certificate."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/132/132508.png?src=api&modified=1396025642","width":"525","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/132/132508.png?src=api&modified=1396025642","thumbnailWidth":"150","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"cia.gov with a weak security profile without Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/132/132510.png?src=api&modified=1396025642","width":"638","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/132/132510.png?src=api&modified=1396025642","thumbnailWidth":"182","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"paypal with a very weak \"encrypted\" connection. sites handling currency should know better."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/132/132512.png?src=api&modified=1396025642","width":"507","height":"507","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/132/132512.png?src=api&modified=1396025642","thumbnailWidth":"150","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"NSA main site; an example site with no encryption at all."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/132/132514.png?src=api&modified=1396025642","width":"462","height":"465","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/132/132514.png?src=api&modified=1396025642","thumbnailWidth":"149","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"the add-on \"security\" tab from the options window."}],"averageRating":4,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/calomel-ssl-validation/?src=api","homepageURL":"https://calomel.org/firefox_ssl_validation.html","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/257802/calomel_ssl_validation-0.72-fx.xpi?src=api","size":195819,"developerComments":"INSTALLATION NOTES: After the initial install, the Calomel toolbar button will be placed to the left of the URL location bar.

Why not change it?\n• .. or you simply like to experiment.\n\nHow?\nStart up this add-on when you like to change the colors of a site. Then press the button [Go!] and change the colors for Foreground (Text) and Background with some dials.\n\n'Under the hood' this Add-On does (apparently) more: It overrides the CSS of a site and uses a number of \"tricks\" to be as complete as possible. Also image processing and re-encoding is done to change the color of (background-)images.\n\nLimitations:\n• On complex sites with many background images this add-on might need much memory while editing.\n• Contents which use plugins like Flash or PDF files can not be changed.\n• Whether color edits on one web page apply to the whole site or not, depends on the sites CSS structure. But multiple edits can be applied to different pages/folders of the site.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/47/47510.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","width":"700","height":"520","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/47/47510.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"148","caption":"Examples of colour changes done with this add-on.

It has been specially designed for Seven (with Aero Style enabled), but rendering is relatively accurate on XP and Linux (I can t test it on MAC, but for those who would like to try it anyway on that platform, you can force download and once the package downloaded on your computer, you can install it manually by dragging it into the add-ons manager). It contains no added functionalities, it's simply a full Firefox's GUI customization.\n\n• Userstyles to customize a bit more your FT Deepdark (such as : dark \"about:home\", \"aero style\" for tabs and tab bar background, translucent scrollbars, darker url bar background, ...) are available here\n• IMPORTANT ! To use these \"userstyles\" you need first to install an add-on called \"Stylish\" which you'll find here\n\n• 10beta25 version available here for download\n\n• What to do when facing an issue with an FT theme ?\n\n1) before reporting it, first try to see if the issue is due to the theme itself. How ? Enable the default theme and check if the issue is still there. If not, enable again the FT theme, but disable all other installed addons to check if the issue can be due to a conflict between addons.\n\n2) If the issue is still there after disabling all other addons and if the default theme doesn t have that issue, try to download and install again the theme (check also if you have the latest version installed, maybe the bug you want to report has already been solved with the latest updates).\n\n3) if after trying what mentioned above the problem is linked with the use of the FT theme, please, send me an e-mail (there is a link on the add-ons page to contact me) instead of reporting the bug in the add-on's review section. When sending an e-mail to report a bug, do not forget to tell me which operating system (Windows XP, 7, Vista, Linux, etc.) you are running on your computer, which version of Firefox and FT theme you are using and if you have any operating system custom theme (it can also be a cause of the issue). Then, describe the most precisely you can the issue you are facing and, if possible, please, join a screenshot and/or a short video so I could see exactly how it looks (English is not my mother tongue as you can easily notice, so a picture can avoid the language problems ;). All that will help me to understand better what is the problem and to solve it quicker if possible (as everyone, my knowledges have limits ;).\nI can t promise you that I ll manage to fix every problems and also in short time, but I ll do my best for it. I m working on FT themes during my free time so it can take a bit time before fixing the issues (you need also to be conscious that any updates need to be checked by Mozilla first, but if you want to have the updates a bit quicker you can follow me on Twitter and know immediately when a new version is available for download).\n\nThanks for visiting the FT Themes pages and enjoy the web with Firefox :)","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":"Free for non-commercial personal use.
